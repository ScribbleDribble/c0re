process management: 
- separate kernel and user stacks
- swap out process address space on context switch 
- implement proper scheduler 
- testing for an arbitrary amount processes
- fix kernel stack from gradually falling in address space due to context switching  
- will need to reload MSR ESP0 on each context switch, so that process can execute on its own kernel stack on each system call
- refactor

system calls:
- set up correct kernel stack pointer
- return to user stack and resume execution
- ability to pass in parameters to system call functions 
- complete stdio interface (low priority)
- cleaner interface - look into other kernel designs 

vmm
- stricter permissions for kernel code segments 
- *long term* Remap kernel to start at higher memory (0xC0000...) like linux
- *long term* code to obtain memory map

pmm 
- *long term* Increase available memory to 256MB
- add tests. ensure initialisation, bitmap array, allocation and freeing are correct

interrupts.c 
- merge idt.c, isr.c, irq.c


cleaner Makefile

Future: qemu e2e tests. Dump logs from qemu and read data using python testing script. 
E.g. check state of registers from log file. Must use:
