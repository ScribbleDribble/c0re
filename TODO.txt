basic shell
- need some kind of scanf call. buffer to read from text. 

fix warnings

scheduler:
improve scheduling algo
signals 

processes
- implement copy-on-write

system calls:
- complete stdio interface 
- cleaner interface - look into other kernel designs 

kmalloc/malloc
- seperate user and kernel heaps - implement malloc for userspace programs

vmm
- stricter permissions for kernel code and data
- mark shared kernel page tables as global 
- *long term* code to obtain memory map
- heap to grow downwards. palloc calls must decrement pd idxs but check beforehand.

pmm 
- stack based management for O(1) page frame allocation

trap.c 
- merge idt.c, isr.c, irq.c


cleaner Makefile

Future: move to 64-bit? although we may be in too deep for that...

// todo when cloning process, use saved register state from parent process
